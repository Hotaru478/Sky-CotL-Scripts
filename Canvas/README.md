# Welcome to Canvas!

## What's Canvas?
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Canvas**, also known as **Sky Modloader**, is a lightweight wrapper around the Sky app made by [@artdeell](https://github.com/artdeell) and [@lukas0x1](https://github.com/lukas0x1). It takes up a sole **~15 MB** of your phone's storage and hooks into Sky at runtime, thus acting as "bridge" and providing an interface that developers can build plug-ins on top of. It's completely modular, so you can load existing plug-ins or write your own. The main advantage of Canvas over traditional mods is that it doesn't require elevated privileges or any specific programming skills. Canvas is important, but requires libs to be fully operational.

## Libs?
- üìö **Userlibs**, or simply **Libs**, are fan-made helper programs (libraries) for Canvas that actually unleash its true power. Some of these libs include Auto CRing, melting, spell modification, or virtually anything as per your liking.

## Available Libs:
- **Autowax** (aka. **libaw4c**) - A free helper program that collects the max number of daily available candles at the tap of a button, with extra features such WL, spirit collection, etc.
- **libsMite** - Universal mod with Semi-AutoCR, Auto burn, Relationship unlocks, etc.
- **libRomanBeta** - Universal mod for Sky Beta
- **libRomanDev** - Substitutes the Beta server with the Dev one (an even more private server, originally only for TGC devs)
- **libfun** - Universal mod, but paid and poorly maintained

Discontinued - **!! do not use !!**
- **reHell** or **libgxost** - Universal mod, no longer maintained
- **libHellboy** - Universal mod, no longer maintained

‚¨ÜÔ∏è <ins>It's worth noting that these add-ons are fan-made and can have lots of advantages (or otherwise cause trouble) depending on the author's intentions.</ins> ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

## System Requirements:
- A mobile phone capable of running Sky and Android not less than version 7.1
- Root is not necessary, but a basic understanding of sideloading, navigating the filesystem and technical troubleshooting might come in handy
- Apple iOS and emulators are not supported

## Getting Started

1. Download **Canvas.apk** from [here](https://github.com/lukas0x1/SML-filehost/releases/latest/download/Canvas.apk) and **AutoWax** from [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1015510665013776454/1119000686076637254/libaw4c.1.3.7.so).
2. Open your File Manager and navigate to your **Downloads** (e.g. `/storage/emulated/0/Download/`).
3. Tap on **Canvas.apk**. If prompted, allow the installation from unknown sources and proceed.
4. Hit **"Done"** *(don't open yet!)*.
5. Find the newly added **"Mod Manager"** in your app drawer.
6. Hit **"Add Mod"** on the top left. Navigate to your downloads and import **aw4c.xyz.so** *(xyz being the version number)*.
7. Repeat step 6 for any other mods you might have.
8. Close **Mod Manager** *(swipe from your recent apps)*.
9. Launch **Canvas**, sign in to Sky and enjoy!

## Updating old Mods
To update your existing mods (files ending in *.so), do the following:
1. Find and download a newer version of your mod.
2. Navigate to the **Mod Manager** on your home screen.
3. **Remove** the desired mod *(press the recycle bin icon next to its name)*.
4. Tap **"Add Mod"** > locate your new mod > import it.
5. Close **Mod Manager** *(swipe from your recent apps)*.
6. Your mod is updated and ready to use!

## Is Canvas safe?
- Yes, Canvas unto itself is completely [safe](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis/Nzc3NWU2ZTE1NjdmNDM3NTcyYzY0YzdiN2ZlNmRhNzk6MTY4MzIwODIzNQ==). However, it allows mods, whether third-party or not, to have full control of your active Sky instance, be able to read your account info and such. So it's advisable to use your brain and pay attention to people's reviews before use. Moreover, some mods offer features that are considered "risky", such spam honk, teleportation by coordinates, auto melt,... which can draw other's attention and make them report you to tgc. Again, stay away from openly showing or talking about cheats, and you should be fine.
